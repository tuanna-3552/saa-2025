# The Seven Stages

Every discipline shares the same seven stages. What differs is the pace and the pauses.

**Task Tool Fallback:** `TaskCreate`/`TaskUpdate`/`TaskGet`/`TaskList` are CLI-only — unavailable in VSCode extension. If they error, use `TodoWrite` for tracking. All stages remain functional without Task tools.

## Stage 0: Read the Material

1. Parse input with `intent-detection.md` rules
2. Log detected discipline: `⚒ Stage 0: Discipline [X] — [reason]`
3. If discipline=code: detect blueprint path, set active plan
4. Use `TaskCreate` to create stage tasks (with dependencies if complex)

**Output:** `⚒ Stage 0: Discipline [interactive|auto|fast|parallel|no-test|code] — [detection reason]`

## Stage 1: Study the Craft (skip if fast/code)

**Interactive/Auto:**
- Spawn multiple `researcher` agents in parallel
- Use `/tkm:scan-codebase ext` or `scout` agent for codebase reading
- Keep reports ≤150 lines

**Parallel:**
- Optional: max 2 researchers if the work is complex

**Output:** `⚒ Stage 1: Study complete — [N] reports gathered`

### [Rest Point 1] After Study (skip if auto)
- Present study summary to user
- Use `AskUserQuestion` to ask: "Proceed to blueprint?" / "Request further study" / "Abort"
- **Auto discipline:** Skip this rest point

### MoMorph Parallel UI Hook (between Stage 1 and Stage 2)

**Trigger:** User input contains MoMorph URL (`momorph.ai/files/*/screens/*`), explicit `fileKey`/`screenId`, or keyword "momorph"/"figma" referencing a screen to implement.

**When triggered, BEFORE entering Stage 2:**
1. Collect all screen identifiers from user input (may be 1 or N screens)
2. Fetch per screen in parallel: `get_frame(screenId)` + `download_specs(screen_id, "csv")` + `download_test_cases(screen_id, "csv")`
3. **Spawn one background `implementer` subagent PER SCREEN** (via `Agent` with `run_in_background: true`). All UI agents run concurrently:
   - Each subagent uses `momorph-implement-design` skill for its screen
   - Mock data extracted directly from Figma design (text, images, sample values visible in the design) — NO invented data
   - Prompt MUST include: MoMorph URL, fileKey, screenId, project conventions path
   - Each subagent reports back: files created, component tree, data interfaces/props expected
4. **DO NOT wait for UI agents.** Continue immediately to Stage 2 (Blueprint) → Stage 3 (Forge). Blueprint and forge proceed in parallel with UI agents.
5. **Integration is incremental:** As each UI agent completes (background notification), integrate its output with the forged logic. No hard merge point — work flows continuously.

**If NOT triggered:** Proceed to Stage 2 normally.

See `.claude/rules/momorph/momorph-development.md` → "Parallel Execution Strategy" for full protocol.

## Stage 2: Draft the Blueprint

**Interactive/Auto/No-test:**
- Use `planner` agent with study context
- Create `plan.md` + `phase-XX-*.md` files

**Fast:**
- Use `/tkm:create-plan --fast` with scout results only
- Minimal blueprint, focus on action

**Parallel:**
- Use `/tkm:create-plan --parallel` for dependency graph + file ownership matrix

**Code:**
- Skip — blueprint already exists
- Parse existing plan for phases

**Output:** `⚒ Stage 2: Blueprint drafted — [N] phases`

### [Rest Point 2] After Blueprint (skip if auto)
- Present blueprint overview with phases
- Use `AskUserQuestion` to ask: "Validate the blueprint or approve to begin forging?" — "Validate" / "Approve" / "Abort" / "Other" ("Request revisions")
  - "Validate": run `/tkm:create-plan validate` skill invocation
  - "Approve": proceed to forge
  - "Abort": stop the workflow
  - "Other": revise the blueprint based on feedback
- **Auto discipline:** Skip this rest point

## Stage 3: Forge the Piece

**IMPORTANT:**
1. `TaskList` first — check for existing tasks (hydrated by planning skill in same session)
2. If tasks exist → pick them up, skip re-creation
3. If no tasks → read plan phases, `TaskCreate` for each unchecked `[ ]` item with priority order and metadata (`phase`, `planDir`, `phaseFile`)
4. Tasks can be blocked by other tasks via `addBlockedBy`

**All disciplines:**
- Use `TaskUpdate` to mark tasks as `in_progress` immediately
- Execute phase tasks sequentially (Stage 3.1, 3.2, etc.)
- Use `ui-ux-designer` for frontend (activate `sk:ui-ux-pro-max` first for style selection if no design system exists)
- Use `sk:ai-multimodal` for image assets
- Run type checking after each file

**Parallel discipline:**
- Utilize all tools of Claude Tasks: `TaskCreate`, `TaskUpdate`, `TaskGet` and `TaskList`
- Launch multiple `implementer` agents
- When agents pick up a task, use `TaskUpdate` to assign and mark `in_progress` immediately
- Respect file ownership boundaries
- Wait for parallel group before advancing

**Output:** `⚒ Stage 3: Forged [N] files — [X/Y] tasks complete`

### [Rest Point 3] After Forge (skip if auto)
- Present forge summary (files changed, key changes)
- Use `AskUserQuestion` to ask: "Proceed to tempering?" / "Request forge changes" / "Abort"
- **Auto discipline:** Skip this rest point

## Stage 4: Temper the Edge (skip if no-test)

**All disciplines (except no-test):**
- Write tests: happy path, edge cases, errors
- **MUST** spawn `tester` subagent: `Task(subagent_type="tester", prompt="Run test suite", description="Temper the work")`
- If failures: **MUST** spawn `debugger` subagent → fix → repeat
- **Forbidden:** fake mocks, commented tests, changed assertions, skipping subagent delegation

**Output:** `⚒ Stage 4: Tempering [X/X passed] — tester subagent invoked`

### [Rest Point 4] After Tempering (skip if auto)
- Present tempering results summary
- Use `AskUserQuestion` to ask: "Proceed to inspection?" / "Request tempering fixes" / "Abort"
- **Auto discipline:** Skip this rest point

## Stage 5: Master's Inspection

**All disciplines — MANDATORY subagent:**
- **MUST** spawn `reviewer` subagent: `Task(subagent_type="reviewer", prompt="Inspect changes. Return score, critical defects, concerns, refinements.", description="Inspect work")`
- **DO NOT** inspect code yourself — delegate to the reviewer

**Interactive/Parallel/Code/No-test:**
- Interactive cycle (max 3): see `review-cycle.md`
- Requires user approval

**Auto:**
- Auto-approve if score≥9.5 AND 0 critical defects
- Auto-fix critical defects (max 3 cycles)
- Escalate to user after 3 failed cycles

**Fast:**
- Simplified inspection, no fix loop
- User approves or aborts

**Output:** `⚒ Stage 5: Inspection [score]/10 — [Approved|Auto-approved] — reviewer subagent invoked`

## Stage 6: Deliver the Work

### Step 6.a — Artifact detection (orchestrator, before doc-writer spawn)

Run this detection BEFORE spawning `doc-writer`. The orchestrator resolves the conditional and renders the prompt with the artifact branch already inlined or omitted — `doc-writer` does NOT see literal `[IF SPECS_PRESENT > 0:]` markers.

```bash
SPECS_PRESENT=$(ls docs/specs/*.md 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ')
# Step 6 runs BEFORE git-manager commits, so capture uncommitted working tree + index vs HEAD.
# Includes both staged and unstaged changes from this session.
CHANGED_FILES=$(git diff --name-only HEAD 2>/dev/null)

# Advisory: signal absent doc layer when session changed substantial feature surface.
# Source for trigger patterns: claude/skills/takumi/references/subagent-patterns.md
#                              → ## Documentation → Trigger Mapping
TRIGGER_HITS=0
if [ -n "$CHANGED_FILES" ]; then
  TRIGGER_HITS=$(echo "$CHANGED_FILES" \
    | grep -vE '/(tests?|__tests__|spec|mocks?|fixtures?)/|\.(test|spec)\.' \
    | grep -cE '/(routes?|controllers?|api|endpoints?|models?|schema|migrations?|prisma|pages?|screens?|views?|router|navigation|auth|rbac|policy|guard|middleware|jobs?|queues?|workers?|cron|listeners?|webhooks?|observers?)/')
fi

if [ ! -d docs ] && [ "$TRIGGER_HITS" -ge 2 ]; then
  echo "ℹ  ./docs/ not found — ${TRIGGER_HITS} feature-surface files changed this session." 1>&2
  echo "ℹ  Consider /tkm:manage-docs init to scaffold project docs." 1>&2
elif [ -d docs ] && [ "$SPECS_PRESENT" = "0" ] && [ "$TRIGGER_HITS" -ge 2 ]; then
  echo "ℹ  docs/specs/ absent — ${TRIGGER_HITS} feature-surface files changed this session." 1>&2
  echo "ℹ  Consider /tkm:rebuild-spec to generate spec layer for richer planning context." 1>&2
fi
```

- If `SPECS_PRESENT == 0` → omit the artifact branch from the `doc-writer` prompt. No warning, no extra prompt bloat.
- If `SPECS_PRESENT > 0` → build `IMPACT_MAP` from `CHANGED_FILES` using the trigger table in `subagent-patterns.md` → `## Documentation` → Trigger Mapping (single source — do NOT duplicate the table here).
- If `CHANGED_FILES` is empty (e.g. user already committed before invoking finalize) → fall back to the active phase's "Related code files" list, or to `git diff --name-only HEAD~..HEAD` for the last commit. Log which source was used.

Detection is idempotent: `docs/specs/` absence exits cleanly with no error. `tr -d ' '` normalizes BSD-`wc` whitespace padding so `[ "$SPECS_PRESENT" = "0" ]` comparisons work.

**Absent-layer advisory:** the `if/elif` block above is stderr-only and **never** enters the `doc-writer` prompt — `doc-writer` still sees the same artifact branch (omitted when `SPECS_PRESENT == 0`). The two layers are mutually exclusive by control flow: `docs/` missing suppresses the specs advisory because `docs/specs/` cannot exist without its parent. Threshold is `≥ 2` feature-surface hits **after** stripping test/mock/fixture paths, so single-file or pure-test sessions stay silent. Contract details: [`_shared/docs-canonical-mapping.md` § Absent-Layer Advisory](../../_shared/docs-canonical-mapping.md#absent-layer-advisory).

**All modes - MANDATORY subagents (NON-NEGOTIABLE):**
1. **MUST** spawn these subagents in parallel:
   - `Task(subagent_type="project-manager", prompt="Run full sync-back for [plan-path]: reconcile all completed Claude Tasks with all phase files, backfill stale completed checkboxes across every phase, then update plan.md frontmatter/table progress. Do NOT only mark current phase.", description="Update plan")`
   - `doc-writer` — use the canonical prompt template in `subagent-patterns.md` → `## Documentation`. Substitute `[plan-name]` with the active plan name, inline `CHANGED_FILES`, and (when `SPECS_PRESENT > 0`) inline the resolved `IMPACT_MAP` from 6.a. DO NOT duplicate the template body here (DRY).
2. Project-manager sync-back MUST include:

### Status Sync (Deliver)

Use CLI commands for deterministic status updates:

```bash
# Mark completed phases
ck plan check <phase-id>

# Mark in-progress phases
ck plan check <phase-id> --start

# Revert if needed
ck plan uncheck <phase-id>
```

**Fallback:** If `ck` is not available, edit plan.md directly —
only change the Status column cell, preserve table structure.
   - Sweep all `phase-XX-*.md` files in the plan directory.
   - Mark every completed item `[ ] → [x]` based on completed tasks (including earlier phases finished before current phase).
   - Update `plan.md` status/progress (`pending`/`in-progress`/`completed`) from actual checkbox state.
   - Return unresolved mappings if any completed task cannot be matched to a phase file.
3. Use `TaskUpdate` to mark Claude Tasks complete after sync-back confirmation.
4. Onboarding check (API keys, env vars)
5. **MUST** spawn git subagent: `Task(subagent_type="git-manager", prompt="Stage and commit changes", description="Commit work")`

**CRITICAL:** Step 6 is INCOMPLETE without running artifact detection (6.a) AND spawning all 3 subagents. DO NOT skip subagent delegation. DO NOT pass literal `[IF SPECS_PRESENT > 0:]` to `doc-writer` — orchestrator resolves the conditional first.

**Auto discipline:** Continue to next phase automatically, return to **Stage 3**.
**Others:** Ask user before next phase

**Output:** `⚒ Stage 6: Delivered — 3 subagents invoked — Full-plan sync-back complete — Committed`

## Discipline Flow Summary

Legend: `[R]` = Rest Point (human approval required)

```
interactive: 0 → 1 → [R] → 2 → [R] → 3 → [R] → 4 → [R] → 5(user) → 6
auto:        0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5(auto) → 6 → next phase (NO pauses)
fast:        0 → skip → 2(fast) → [R] → 3 → [R] → 4 → [R] → 5(simple) → 6
parallel:    0 → 1? → [R] → 2(parallel) → [R] → 3(multi-agent) → [R] → 4 → [R] → 5(user) → 6
no-test:     0 → 1 → [R] → 2 → [R] → 3 → [R] → skip → 5(user) → 6
code:        0 → skip → skip → 3 → [R] → 4 → [R] → 5(user) → 6
```

**Key distinction:** `auto` is the ONLY discipline that skips all rest points.

## Critical Rules

- Never skip stages without discipline justification
- **MANDATORY DELEGATION:** Stages 4, 5, 6 MUST spawn subagents via Task tool. DO NOT perform directly.
  - Stage 4: `tester` (and `debugger` if failures)
  - Stage 5: `reviewer`
  - Stage 6: `project-manager`, `doc-writer`, `git-manager`
- Use `TaskCreate` for each unchecked item with priority order and dependencies (or `TodoWrite` if Task tools unavailable).
- Use `TaskUpdate` to mark `in_progress` when picking up a task (skip if Task tools unavailable).
- Use `TaskUpdate` to mark `complete` immediately after the task is finished (skip if Task tools unavailable).
- All stage outputs follow format: `⚒ Stage [N]: [status] — [metrics]`
- **VALIDATION:** If Task tool calls = 0 at end of workflow, the work is INCOMPLETE.
