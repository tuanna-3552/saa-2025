# Parallel Workflow (`--parallel`)

**Thinking level:** Ultrathink parallel
**User gates:** Design approval only. Implementation uses multi-agent parallel execution.

## Step 1: Research

Spawn max 2 `researcher` agents in parallel:
- Explore requirements, validation, challenges, solutions
- Keep reports ≤150 lines

No user gate — proceed automatically.

## Step 2: Tech Stack

Use `planner` + multiple `researcher` agents in parallel for best-fit stack.
Write to `./docs` directory (≤150 lines).

No user gate — proceed automatically.

## Step 3: Wireframe & Design

1. Use `ui-ux-designer` + `researcher` agents in parallel:
   - Research style, trends, fonts, colors, spacing, positions
   - Predict Google Fonts name (NOT just Inter/Poppins)
   - Describe assets for `sk:ai-multimodal` generation
2. `ui-ux-designer` creates:
   - Design guidelines at `./docs/design-guidelines.md`
   - Wireframes in HTML at `./docs/wireframe/`
3. If no logo: generate with `sk:ai-multimodal` skill
4. Screenshot with `sk:chrome-devtools` → save to `./docs/wireframes/`

**Gate:** Ask user to approve design. Repeat if rejected.

**Image tools:** `sk:ai-multimodal` for generation/analysis, `imagemagick` for crop/resize, background removal tool as needed.

## Step 4: Parallel Planning

Activate **sk:plan** skill: `/tkm:create-plan --parallel <requirements>`
- Creates phases with **exclusive file ownership** per phase (no overlap)
- **Dependency matrix**: which phases run concurrently vs sequentially
- `plan.md` includes dependency graph, execution strategy, file ownership matrix
- Task hydration with `addBlockedBy` for sequential deps, no blockers for parallel groups

No user gate — proceed to implementation.

## Step 5: Parallel Implementation → Final Report

Load `references/shared-phases.md` for remaining phases.

Activate **tkm:takumi** skill: `/tkm:takumi --parallel <plan-path>`
- Read `plan.md` for dependency graph and execution strategy
- Launch multiple `implementer` agents in PARALLEL for concurrent phases
  - Pass: phase file path, environment info
- Use `ui-ux-designer` for frontend (generate/analyze assets with `sk:ai-multimodal`, edit with `imagemagick`)
- Respect file ownership boundaries
- Run type checking after implementation

Takumi handles testing, review, docs, onboarding, final report per `shared-phases.md`.
