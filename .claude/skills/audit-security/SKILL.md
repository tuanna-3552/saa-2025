# Testing Every Joint

A craftsman who finishes a piece without stress-testing every joint has not finished the piece.
The joint that holds under light load will snap under real use. The surface that looks sealed will leak under pressure.
This skill presses every joint: STRIDE threat modeling against every entry point, OWASP patterns against every data boundary, severity-ranked so the worst cracks are fixed first.

With `--fix`: applies repairs iteratively using the `tkm:auto-research` guard pattern.

## When to Apply

- Before a release or major deployment
- After adding auth, payment, or data-handling features
- Periodic security review (monthly/quarterly)
- Compliance check (SOC 2, GDPR, PCI-DSS prep)

## When NOT to Use

- Purely cosmetic changes (CSS, copy edits)
- No user-facing code or data handling involved

## Modes

| Mode | Invocation | Behavior |
|------|-----------|----------|
| Audit only | `/tkm:audit-security <scope>` | Scan → categorize → report |
| Audit + Fix | `/tkm:audit-security <scope> --fix` | Scan → categorize → fix iteratively |
| Bounded fix | `/tkm:audit-security <scope> --fix --iterations N` | Limit fix iterations to N |

---

## Audit Methodology

### 1. Scope Resolution
Expand the provided glob or `full` keyword into a file list. Read all in-scope files before analysis.

### 2. STRIDE Analysis
Evaluate each threat category systematically:
- **S**poofing — identity/authentication weaknesses
- **T**ampering — input validation, integrity controls
- **R**epudiation — audit logging gaps
- **I**nformation Disclosure — data leakage, secret exposure
- **D**enial of Service — rate limits, resource exhaustion
- **E**levation of Privilege — broken access control, RBAC gaps

### 3. OWASP Top 10 Check
Map findings to OWASP categories (A01–A10). See `references/stride-owasp-checklist.md` for per-category checks.

### 4. Dependency Audit
Run the appropriate package audit tool for the detected stack:
- Node.js: `npm audit`
- Python: `pip-audit`
- Go: `govulncheck`
- Ruby: `bundle audit`

### 5. Secret Detection
Scan for hardcoded API keys, passwords, tokens, and private keys using regex patterns. See `references/stride-owasp-checklist.md` → Secret Patterns.

### 6. Finding Categorization
Assign each finding a severity level (see Severity Definitions below).

## Output Format

```
## Security Audit Report

### Summary
- Files scanned: N
- Findings: X critical, Y high, Z medium, W low, V info

### Findings

| # | Severity | Category | File:Line | Description | Fix Recommendation |
|---|----------|----------|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| 1 | Critical  | Injection | api/users.ts:45 | SQL string concatenation | Use parameterized queries |
| 2 | High      | Auth      | auth/login.ts:12 | No rate limiting | Add express-rate-limit |
```

## Fix Mode (--fix)

When `--fix` is provided, apply fixes iteratively after the audit:

1. Sort all findings by severity (Critical → High → Medium → Low)
2. For each finding:
   a. Apply one targeted fix
   b. Run guard (tests or lint) to verify no regression
   c. Commit: `security(fix-N): <short description>`
   d. Advance to next finding
3. Stop early if guard fails — report the failure instead of proceeding
4. Uses `tkm:auto-research` guard pattern for regression prevention

> Tip: Use `--iterations N` to cap total fix iterations when scope is large.

## Severity Definitions

| Severity | Description | Fix Priority |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| Critical | Exploitable now, data breach or RCE risk | Immediate — block release |
| High | Exploitable with moderate effort, significant impact | This sprint |
| Medium | Limited exploitability or impact | Next sprint |
| Low | Theoretical risk, defense-in-depth improvement | Backlog |
| Info | Best practice suggestion, no direct risk | Optional |

---

## Integration with Other Skills

- Run after `tkm:predict-risks` when the security persona flags concerns
- Feed Critical/High findings into `tkm:auto-research --fix` for automated remediation
- Pair with `tkm:create-plan` to schedule Medium/Low findings as sprint tasks

---

## Example Invocations

```bash
# Audit API layer only
/tkm:audit-security src/api/**/*.ts

# Audit entire src/ and auto-fix, max 15 iterations
/tkm:audit-security src/ --fix --iterations 15

# Full codebase audit (no fix)
/tkm:audit-security full
```
