# Laying the Foundation

Everything the application does rests on the database. Every schema decision made now will be excavated and rebuilt later if made carelessly.
The foundation craftsman does not choose a schema because it is convenient today — they choose one that will not crack under the weight of tomorrow's query.

MongoDB for document-oriented work. PostgreSQL for relational integrity. Both disciplines; neither as a default.

## When to Apply This Skill

Use when:
- Designing database schemas and data models
- Writing queries (SQL or MongoDB query language)
- Building aggregation pipelines or complex joins
- Optimizing indexes and query performance
- Implementing database migrations
- Setting up replication, sharding, or clustering
- Configuring backups and disaster recovery
- Managing database users and permissions
- Analyzing slow queries and performance issues
- Administering production database deployments

## Reference Navigation

### Database Design
- **[db-design.md](references/db-design.md)** - Activate when user requests: Database/table design for transactional (OLTP), analytics (OLAP), create or extend schema, design fact/dimension tables, analyze/review CSV/JSON/SQL files to create tables, or need advice on data storage structure.

### MongoDB References
- **[mongodb-crud.md](references/mongodb-crud.md)** - CRUD operations, query operators, atomic updates
- **[mongodb-aggregation.md](references/mongodb-aggregation.md)** - Aggregation pipeline, stages, operators, patterns
- **[mongodb-indexing.md](references/mongodb-indexing.md)** - Index types, compound indexes, performance optimization
- **[mongodb-atlas.md](references/mongodb-atlas.md)** - Atlas cloud setup, clusters, monitoring, search

### PostgreSQL References
- **[postgresql-queries.md](references/postgresql-queries.md)** - SELECT, JOINs, subqueries, CTEs, window functions
- **[postgresql-psql-cli.md](references/postgresql-psql-cli.md)** - psql commands, meta-commands, scripting
- **[postgresql-performance.md](references/postgresql-performance.md)** - EXPLAIN, query optimization, vacuum, indexes
- **[postgresql-administration.md](references/postgresql-administration.md)** - User management, backups, replication, maintenance

## Python Utilities

Database utility scripts in `scripts/`:
- **db_migrate.py** - Generate and apply migrations for both databases (MongoDB and PostgreSQL)
- **db_backup.py** - Backup and restore MongoDB and PostgreSQL
- **db_performance_check.py** - Analyze slow queries and recommend indexes

```bash
# Generate migration
python scripts/db_migrate.py --db mongodb --generate "add_user_index"

# Run backup
python scripts/db_backup.py --db postgres --output /backups/

# Check performance
python scripts/db_performance_check.py --db mongodb --threshold 100ms
```

## Best Practices

**MongoDB:**
- Use embedded documents for 1-to-few relationships
- Reference documents for 1-to-many or many-to-many
- Index frequently queried fields
- Use aggregation pipeline for complex transformations
- Enable authentication and TLS in production
- Use Atlas for managed hosting

**PostgreSQL:**
- Normalize schema to 3NF, denormalize for performance
- Use foreign keys for referential integrity
- Index foreign keys and frequently filtered columns
- Use EXPLAIN ANALYZE to optimize queries
- Regular VACUUM and ANALYZE maintenance
- Connection pooling (pgBouncer) for web apps
