# Pipeline — Wave Dependency Graph

Expresses rebuild-spec artifact generation order as `TaskCreate` chains.
Execution handled by TaskList — no custom orchestrator needed.

## Waves

| Wave | Artifact(s) | Depends On | Parallel |
|------|-------------|------------|---------|
| 0 | Scout discovery | — | yes |
| 1 | SystemOverview, RouteList, DataModel | W0 | yes |
| 2 | ScreenList + ScreenFlow | W1 (RouteList + DataModel) | — |
|   | BackgroundLogic | W2 (ScreenList + ScreenFlow) | — |
| 3 | Permissions | W2 (ScreenList + BackgroundLogic) | — |
| 4 | UserStories | W3 | — |
| 5 | FeatureList | W4 | — |
| 6 | FeatureSpec × F### | W5 | yes (fan-out) |
| 7a | Core artifact reviewer | W5 | yes (parallel with W6) |
| 7b | Feature spec reviewer (batched, 5/reviewer) | W6 | yes (batches parallel) |
| 7-merge | Combine review reports | W7a + W7b | — |
| 8 | Implementer + Re-reviewer (fix cycles, max 3, conditional) | W7-merge | — |
| 9 | Doc-writer (persist to docs/specs/) | W8 | — |

## Task chain pattern

```
// Wave 0
TaskCreate({ subject: "Scout: discovery scan",
  description: "Scan routing, data models, screens, bg logic, permissions. Detect project language from manifest (package.json → JS/TS; composer.json → PHP; Gemfile → Ruby; pyproject.toml → Python; pom.xml/build.gradle → Java; go.mod → Go; Cargo.toml → Rust). Scan all non-test, non-vendor source dirs relevant to the detected stack (e.g. pages/, views/, components/, features/, modules/ for JS/TS; app/Http/, resources/views/ for Laravel; app/controllers/, app/views/ for Rails; adapt accordingly). Multi-manifest rule: if multiple manifests coexist at root level (e.g. package.json + composer.json), the root-level manifest wins; priority order JS/TS > PHP > Ruby > Python > Java > Go > Rust if tied at same depth. Emit [MULTI_STACK] note in scout-report.md Notes section listing all detected stacks. Output MUST follow templates/scout-report-template.md. File Inventory is the contract for Wave 2 content-completeness and Wave 7 reviewer cross-validation — every source file must appear. After File Inventory: emit `## Background Logic Source Inventory` section. To do this: (1) read references/bl-source-patterns.md; (2) for Mode A stacks apply the folder-convention globs for the detected stack row; (3) for Mode B stacks apply the annotation/decorator grep markers from bl-source-patterns.md § Mode B Grep Markers; (4) emit one entry per file (Mode A) or per decorator hit (Mode B) sorted by category then path; (5) for any category with no matches emit `_(none found)_`; (6) for stacks/libraries not in the table use [SIGNAL_INFERRED] protocol (see bl-source-patterns.md § Signal Inference Fallback); (7) for [MULTI_STACK] projects emit one subsection per detected stack. Output: plans/<active-plan>/artifacts/scout-report.md" })

Route-first enumeration: Before applying H-rules, cross-reference the RouteList artifact (Wave 1, already complete). Map each distinct URL pattern to its page/component file. Each file serving a distinct URL path = one SCR candidate. Multiple URL patterns mapping to the SAME file = same SCR. Different files → separate SCR candidates. Then apply H1-H6 (full execution order: H6 → H4 → H5 → H2 → H3 → H1 → 2-of-3 gate) within each candidate. Apply composite-screen detection unconditionally to every screen file per references/composite-screen-detection.md. Import chain rule: if scout-report.md exists, use its flat file inventory to identify screen files (do not re-glob); if absent (e.g. --artifact entry point), emit [WARN] scout-report.md not found — skip content-completeness check and mark service coverage N/A. When scout-report exists: (1) resolve path aliases first (read tsconfig.json paths or package.json workspaces — unresolvable → treat as compliant, log [UNRESOLVED_ALIAS]); (2) follow imports one level deep using language-specific mechanism (ES6 import for JS/TS; use/require for PHP; require for Ruby; import for Python; import for Java/Kotlin/Go; use for Rust); (3) extract all service calls, API hooks, and helper functions in those immediate imports; (4) Known Limitation: barrel/re-export files (e.g. index.ts) re-exporting service modules at depth 2 are not followed — flag screens importing ONLY barrel files as [BARREL_IMPORT] advisory.

## Fan-out pattern (Wave 6)

After Fea
**Small codebases (F### count ≤ 20):** flat fan-out — one task per feature, all blocked on FeatureList.

```
// Collect task IDs for Wave 7 blocking
const allFeatureTaskIds = []

// Repeat for every F### found in plans/<active-plan>/artifacts/feature-list.md
const wave6TaskId = TaskCreate({ subject: "Wave6: feature-spec F001_Auth",
  description: `Generate DETAILED spec for F001_Auth.

CONTRACT: Read references/feature-spec-researcher-contract.md for mandatory rules.
TEMPLATE: feature-spec-template.md.
DRAFT: plans/<active-plan>/artifacts/features/F001_Auth/spec.md

CONTEXT LOADING (token-efficient — DO NOT load full artifacts):
1. Grep plans/<active-plan>/artifacts/feature-list.md for the F001 entry.
   Extract all referenced codes: US###, SCR###, ROUTE###, MODEL###, BL###, PERM###.
2. For each referenced code, Grep ONLY that code's section from its artifact:
   - US### → user-stories.md (heading ### US### … read until next ### US)
   - SCR### → screen-list.md (heading ### SCR### … read section)
   - BL### → background-logic.md (heading ### BL### … read section)
   - PERM### → permissions.md (heading ### PERM### … read section)
   - ROUTE### → route-list.md (grep the route entry row)
   - MODEL### → data-model.md (grep the entity entry)
3. Always read in full: system-overview.md (small, provides global context).
4. DO NOT read entire upstream artifacts — only the sections for codes in step 1.

SOURCE CODE: Use Grep/Read to find and read real controller(s), model(s), job(s),
service(s), policy(ies), and page files. Extract file paths, line ranges, method names,
table names, HTTP status codes, job class names, event names from actual code.

ALL TEMPLATE SECTIONS MANDATORY. DEPTH BAR enforced — see contract.`,
  addBlockedBy: [featureListTaskId] })
allFeatureTaskIds.push(wave6TaskId)
```

**Large codebases (F### count > 20):** batch of 10 features per dispatcher task — bounds peak context and gives reviewer intermediate checkpoints.

```
// Chunk F### list into groups of 10
const batches = chunk(fCodes, 10)  // [[F001..F010], [F011..F020], ...]

// Each batch gets a dispatcher task that spawns researcher per feature within it.
// Batches run sequentially to cap parallel subagent count; features within a batch run in parallel.
let prevBatchId = featureListTaskId
for (const [i, batch] of batches.entries()) {
  const batchTaskId = TaskCreate({
    subject: `Wave6.batch-${pad2(i+1)}: feature-specs (${batch[0]}..${batch.at(-1)})`,
    description: `Generate DETAILED specs for ${batch.length} features in parallel: ${batch.join(', ')}.
Apply the same rules as the small-codebase Wave 6 block above to EACH feature in this batch:
- Read researcher contract, use scoped context loading (Grep per-feature codes only), read real source code.

Contract: references/feature-spec-researcher-contract.md.
Template: feature-spec-template.md. Drafts: plans/<active-plan>/artifacts/features/<F###>/spec.md.
On batch completion, write plans/<active-plan>/artifacts/wave6-batch-${pad2(i+1)}.flag listing completed F###.`,
    addBlockedBy: [prevBatchId]
  })
  prevBatchId = batchTaskId
}
// Wave 7 reviewer blocks on the final batch (large codebase)
```

**Rationale:** orchestrator only holds batch-level task state in context at any time, not all N features.

## Review + fix cycle (Waves 7-9)

## Reconcile pattern (run on every invocation)

Before dispatching any new wave, sync TaskList with disk. Closes tasks whose previous session died after the subagent wrote its output but before `TaskUpdate` fired.

```

**With `--resume`:** run the block above, then STOP.
- Tasks closed: report subject + output path
- Tasks still `in_progress` AND output not yet written (STUCK): report as STUCK — user must manually reset to `pending` or `cancelled` before re-running without `--resume`
- Wave 8 tasks (`null` in map): always reported as STUCK if `in_progress` — cannot auto-close
- No new `TaskCreate` calls in resume mode

**Without `--resume` (default no-args):** run reconcile, then dispatch next pending wave.
- STUCK tasks (`in_progress`, no output) are left as-is — orchestrator does NOT re-create them to avoid duplicates
- If a task is STUCK, use `--resume` first to diagnose, then manually reset before re-running

## Artifact paths

| Stage | Draft path | Persistent path |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| Document artifacts | `plans/<active-plan>/artifacts/<name>.md` | `docs/specs/<name>.md` |
| Feature specs | `plans/<active-plan>/artifacts/features/<F###>/spec.md` | `docs/specs/features/<F###>/spec.md` |
| Core review report | `plans/<active-plan>/artifacts/core-review-report.md` | ephemeral (W7a output) |
| Feature review batches | `plans/<active-plan>/artifacts/feature-review-batch-NN.md` | ephemeral (W7b output) |
| Merged review report | `plans/<active-plan>/artifacts/review-report.md` | ephemeral (W7-merge output) |
| Wave 6 batch flags | `plans/<active-plan>/artifacts/wave6-batch-NN.flag` | ephemeral (reconcile signal) |
| Wave 9 completion flag | `plans/<active-plan>/artifacts/wave9-complete.flag` | ephemeral (reconcile signal + audit) |

Doc-writer (Wave 9) promotes drafts only after reviewer passes (`failed === 0`).

## Wave 9 completion flag format

`plans/<active>/artifacts/wave9-complete.flag` is the single source of truth that the pipeline finished. Plain text, one line per promoted file:

```
# Wave 9 complete — <ISO-8601 timestamp>
docs/specs/system-overview.md  <sha256>
docs/specs/route-list.md       <sha256>
docs/specs/data-model.md       <sha256>
docs/specs/screen-list.md      <sha256>
docs/specs/screen-flow.md      <sha256>
docs/specs/background-logic.md <sha256>
docs/specs/permissions.md      <sha256>
docs/specs/user-stories.md     <sha256>
docs/specs/feature-list.md     <sha256>
docs/specs/features/F001_Auth/spec.md <sha256>
...
```

SHA is recorded for audit trail only — reconcile does NOT verify SHA programmatically.
To manually verify integrity: `sha256sum -c wave9-complete.flag` (strip comment lines first).
